# u-hiker-project-1

### In this project we made an app where the user can search cities in GA and find a local park to go to. We used the National Parks Service API (https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) for finding the parks on the landing page and the Mapquest API: (https://developer.mapquest.com/) for the GPS page. In order for the user to navigate to the GPS they have to click the button next to the search button.
##This is where they will be given directions to copy the url and paste it into the desination search input on the GPS page. They also to need to put in their current location address in order for the directions to work.
